# Hey there 👋

I'm **Arjun Vasavan**, an embedded systems engineer from India.

I work on firmware, device drivers, and system-level programming. If something interests me, I'll build it and push it to GitHub.

Currently diving deep into **C programming and Linux internals** at Emertxe. My go-to tools are Vim, GDB.

I'm most interested in real-time systems, low-level optimization, and understanding how things work at the hardware level.

Still learning, still building—probably have more private repos than public ones at this point.

### 🚀 Currently Exploring

- Linux kernel internals and system calls
- Device driver development for embedded systems
- Real-time scheduling algorithms and RTOS
- Bootloaders and bare-metal programming
- Memory management and low-level optimization

### 💡 What I Believe

- Terminal > GUI, always
- Datasheets are the best documentation
- Interrupts > polling
- Good code explains itself (but comments help)
- Printf debugging works, but GDB is better
