# Hey there 👋

I'm **Arjun Vasavan**, an embedded systems engineer from India.

I work on firmware, device drivers, and system-level programming. Currently learning C programming and Linux internals at Emertxe.

Interested in real-time systems, low-level optimization, and understanding how things work at the hardware level.
