# Arjun Vasavan

Embedded systems engineer from India.

I work on firmware, device drivers, and system-level programming.

If something interests me, I'll build it and push it to GitHub.

Currently focused on C, Linux internals, and RTOS at Emertxe. My go-to tools are Vim, GDB, and an oscilloscope.

I've worked on several embedded projects, but I'm most interested in real-time systems and low-level optimization.

Still learning, still building—probably have more private repos than public ones at this point.

**Currently exploring:**  
- Linux kernel internals and system calls  
- Device driver development  
- Real-time scheduling algorithms  
- Bootloaders and bare-metal programming

**Fun facts:**  
- Prefer terminal over GUI  
- Can debug without printf (but still use it)  
- Think datasheets are better than most documentation  
- Interrupts > polling, always
